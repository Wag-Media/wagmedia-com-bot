# Functionality

This document lists all functional requirements for the Wagmedia Communications
Bot

## general

- all messages from bots are ignored
- all dms are ignored
- all messages / reactions / updates / deletes from channels that are not
  monitored are ignored
- the user can configure relevant parts of the bot (e.g. monitored channels,
  logging behavior). For a full list of settings see [`config.ts`](config.ts)
  and the [`env.sample`](.env.sample) for secret settings
- There are two levels of rights the bot differentiates between: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èregular users
  and ü¶πsuperusers (configured to have the "Director" role)

_Complete_ posts get inserted to the db (does not mean published)

- a post is complete if it has a title + description + content link

_Complete_ Odd Jobs get inserted to the db. Oddjobs are incomplete if one of the
following fields is missing:

1. timeline
2. role
